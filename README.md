# chuncho: a centralized library for data I/O and simple plotting

we start by integrating the functionality of pandas, folium, altair, seaborn, networkx and several other packages for 

reading/writing data formats: CSV, JSON, Excel

plotting: heatmaps, violins, sankeys, treemaps, networkx (the big 5)
